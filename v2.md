## 1.6.1 ‚Äî Fix[filesystem]: Btrfs Incoherent Disk Usage

### Summary

The problem arise from a my fundamental misunderstanding of how Btrfs's
**Copy-on-Write (CoW)** mechanism interacts with long-lived **snapshots**.

In Btrfs, when a file is modified, the filesystem does not overwrite the
existing data. Instead, it writes the new data to a different location and
updates the file's metadata to point to the new data blocks. The original data
blocks remain unchanged. This is the **Copy-on-Write** behavior.

This is a very efficient process, but it has a key side effect: if a snapshot
exists, it maintains a reference to the original, unmodified data blocks. As the
system continues to change, these "stale" data blocks accumulate, even if the
files they belong to have been deleted or modified. Btrfs cannot free this space
because the snapshots still reference the data, preventing the filesystem from
reclaiming it.

Over time, this accumulation of referenced but "unseen" data blocks can lead to
a significant discrepancy between the actual disk usage and what is reported by
commands like `du`, which only accounts for the currently active filesystem. The
issue was exacerbated by my use of Snapper, which created snapshots on a regular
basis, thereby maintaining these references and causing the disk space usage to
snowball.

**Note on Defragmentation**: Attempting to defragment the Btrfs filesystem with
`btrfs filesystem defragment` can actually worsen this problem. Defragmentation
also uses CoW, creating new, contiguous data blocks and leaving the old,
fragmented blocks behind. If a snapshot references the original, fragmented
blocks, they will not be freed, resulting in a net increase in disk usage.

### Fix

The solution is to delete the old snapshots. By removing a snapshot, you break
the references to the stale data blocks it holds, allowing Btrfs to reclaim the
space. To prevent the problem from reoccurring, I've configured Snapper to keep
a strict minimum of snapshots and to automatically clean up older ones.

## 1.5.0 ‚Äî Fix[service/daemon]: Docker & Docker desktop conflict over socket üê≥

### Summary

Due to `docker` & `docker-desktop` reimplementing there own `docker.sok`,
commands eg `docker compose` failed due to mismatched files ownership as it was
trying to use `docker-desktop`'s socket version

### Commands

```fish
sudo usermod -aG kvm $USER
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
docker context use default
```

---

## 1.4.1 ‚Äî Patch[service/daemon]: Docker Security Patch üê≥

### Summary

#### **1. Installing Core Security Packages**

```bash
sudo pacman -S iptables-nft apparmor
```

- **`iptables-nft`**: Installs the modern `iptables` backend, `nftables`, for
  advanced network filtering and firewall management. This is the default for
  recent Linux distributions.
- **`apparmor`**: Installs the AppArmor Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system,
  which restricts what programs can do by enforcing security profiles.

#### **2. Configuring and Enabling AppArmor**

```bash
systemctl enable --now apparmor
```

This command enables and starts the AppArmor system service immediately. This
allows AppArmor to load and enforce security profiles for applications,
including Docker containers.

#### **3. Cleaning Up and Installing Docker**

```bash
# Removing the old Docker binary if it exists
rm /usr/local/bin/docker

# Installing the official Arch Linux Docker package
sudo pacman -S docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

- **`rm /usr/local/bin/docker`**: A precautionary step to remove a potentially
  outdated or manually installed Docker binary, ensuring the official Arch
  package is used.
- **`sudo pacman -S docker`**: Installs the Docker daemon and client from the
  official Arch repositories.
- **`sudo systemctl enable docker`**: Configures the Docker daemon to start
  automatically on system boot.

#### **4. Configuring Kernel Security Modules via GRUB**

The following lines were added to the `/etc/default/grub` file.

```bash
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="loglevel=3 quiet lsm=landlock,lockdown,yama,integrity,apparmor,bpf"
GRUB_GFXMODE="1024x768,800x600,auto"
```

- **`lsm=...`**: This option enables a chain of Linux Security Modules (LSMs) at
  boot time, which significantly hardens the kernel.
  - **`landlock`**: Allows unprivileged processes to create sandboxes.
  - **`lockdown`**: Prevents even the root user from compromising kernel
    security.
  - **`yama`**: Restricts the `ptrace` system call, preventing process snooping.
  - **`integrity`**: Enables the Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) to
    verify file integrity.
  - **`apparmor`**: Explicitly loads the AppArmor LSM.
  - **`bpf`**: Enables the BPF LSM, providing enhanced security for BPF
    programs.

#### **5. Applying GRUB Changes**

```bash
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

This command regenerates the GRUB boot configuration file, applying the changes
made to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`. The system must be rebooted for these
kernel LSMs to take effect.

## 1.4.0 ‚Äî Feat[shell/apps]: Added Docker Integration for Service Daemon üê≥

### Summary

This entry introduces **Docker** integration, allowing the service daemon to run
in a containerized environment.

#### **Installation and Setup**

##### **1. Install Docker Engine**

```fish
# Download and extract the static Docker binary
wget https://download.docker.com/linux/static/stable/x86_64/docker-28.4.0.tgz -qO- | tar xvfz - docker/docker --strip-components=1

# Move the binary to a system-wide path
sudo mv ./docker /usr/local/bin
```

##### **2. Install Docker Desktop**

```fish
# Install the Docker Desktop package using pacman
sudo pacman -U ./docker-desktop-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
# Note: By default, Docker Desktop is installed at /opt/docker-desktop.
```

##### **3. Configure `kvm`**

Ensure the `kvm` module is enabled and your user is part of the `kvm` group for
proper virtualization support.

```fish
# Check if the kvm module is loaded
lsmod | grep kvm

# Add your user to the kvm group
sudo usermod -aG kvm $USER
```

### **Notes**

- **`pass` and GPG:** You'll need to generate a GPG key and initialize `pass`
  for secure credential management, which is often used in a containerized
  workflow.

```fish
gpg --generate-key
pass init <gpg_key_id>
```

- **Login to Docker Desktop:** After installation, launch Docker Desktop and log
  in to begin using the service.

- use `modinfo <module-name>` to show info about a specific module

### Fixed

- Discord now launch
  - reason: desktop & usr/bin referenced `/opt/Discord/Discord/Discord` expect
    the real/up to date version live at `~/Discord/Discord`
